  <h1>Julie Bird Photography Website READ ME</h1>
  <p> This websisite was created by Shiloh Parish and Tatum Corley. It is meant as a photography profile website for local Jackson photographer, Julie Bird. Although this is done as a Coding 1 project, we are also doing this as an act of kindness towards a local photographer who we believe deserves more recogintion.</p>
  <p> Julie Bird is a Jackson photographer who has been working five years. While she has a large range of subjects, she specializes in personal, family oriented photography. Julie works for hire and often does work for seniors, weddings, and families.</p>
